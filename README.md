This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
```

The project includes an API mock for the `/api/sign-in` end-point.

The code in this repository was developed using `Node v12.19.0`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the login form demo.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
# then
npm run test:watch
```

The project doesn't have to be running to run the tests, they're independent. The tests use [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) for API mocking.
